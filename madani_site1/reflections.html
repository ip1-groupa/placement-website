                  <h3>My Role at Cim Finance</h3>
                  <p>As a Digital Product Developer at Cim Finance, my main role over 10 weeks was to redesign the customer journeys for different lending products, assist in UI/UX design process, research on specific topics to solidify business cases and carry manual and automated software testing. My responsibilities were as follow:
                    <br>

                    <ul>A. Designing, developing and launching of a Digital Lending & Payments Platform for Cim Finance</ul>
                    <ul>B. Working with the Head of Cards & Payments and CTO for Cim Finance’s Payments Strategy for existing  channels and coming digital channels</ul>

                      <ul>C. Defining new digital products roadmap & strategy for Cim Finance</ul>

                      <ul>D. Research project on AI and Machine Learning in the financial sector, query data and create dashboard, run tests on the models.</ul>

                  </p>

                  <h3>Learning Outcomes </h3>
                  <p>I had an amazing time at Cim Finance once more. Last year I was involved with digital process re-engineering and this year I joined the Digital Product & Innovation department where I could see some of the work I did last year implemented and working effectively. It's great to see that as interns, our work has an impact on the company and they do value us. As expected, I had my lows during work but I caught up easily and managed to cope with the environment. 

                  <br>
                  I learnt a lot from my internship, I got in-depth knowledge in UI/UX design regarding digital lending and I was able to apply my python skills for data mining and analysis. Moreover, I got to interact with the Senior management quite often and went on occasional lunches with the CEO as some senior managers. This internship has been great and I'm really looking forward to applying what I learnt in the near future. 
                  </p>

                  <h3>Lessons Learnt</h3>
                  <p>
                    As I already interned at Cim Finance last year, I did not go with a beginner's mindset. This affected my perspective on certain things, such as the systems and the ways department interact. I assumed that things were the same but, one year changes a lot, indeed. If I could start over, I would definitely spend more time on UI/UX instead of moving to software testing. I enjoyed UI/UX more than anything & I'd rather deepen my knowledge in that area.</p><br>

                       <h3>Advice</h3>
                  <p>
                    My advice to you would be to do a lot of research about your work prior to starting and read about the people you will interact with on a daily basis. This will help you to better communicate to them and relate to their professional knowledge. Always give it your best, even if it means really stretching yourself sometimes. LAst but not least, if the environment is complex, work a lot on your emotional intelligence, it will solve most of your issues as an intern.</p><br>
