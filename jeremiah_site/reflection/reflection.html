		<h2>Application process for Placement</h2>
		<p>This particular placement opportunity was extended to me by the Career Development at my institution, the
			African Leadership University, Mauritius. <br> <br> I was sent the Job description and application
			requirements
			document by email. I wrote up a cover letter and submitted it - along with my resume - to the email
			indicated on the requirements document. I received a reply from Paga's HR team with a date for my
			interview. I was well prepared for my interview when it came around and I received an official offer four
			days later. <br> <br>
			I accepted the offer and took up the job once I returned to Nigeria. </p>

		<h2>Job Details</h2>
		<p> As a Product Manager at Paga, I was assigned to a 5-man unit, concentrating primarily on the overall project
			of managing the Paga app V2 release. My key reponsibilities can be summarized as: <br><br>
			● Map back-office process directly linked to existing Paga products to identify areas of improvement and
			optimisation<br>
			● Carry out research, assess and recommend systems or tools to support internal teams and departments<br>
			● Work closely with product managers to design user journey and experiences across a number of channels
			including mobile, web and USSD<br>
			● Assist with tasks related to identifying, defining and validating user problems

		<h2>Placement Outcome Evaluation</h2>
		<p>I’ve had a truly phenomenal internship experience. I had a few downs during my time at Paga, but it was a
			huge up overall. It was sort of difficult settling into the office at first because I lived far away, and it
			was tedious navigating Lagos traffic to get to work and back every day. I came up with a strong plan to
			battle that problem and life became a lot better. <br>
			My internship at Paga was very hands-on and process oriented and I loved that. I was given full control of a
			lot of the tasks I was assigned and my regular check-ins with my manager helped orient me on the right way
			to go about many tasks. I learned about process optimization, UI/UX design and front-end development. It was
			great to be so integrated into a company and learn about its processes and structures and make actionable
			impact. <br> This placement was a huge success for me and I couldn’t have wished for a better outcome.
		</p>

	<section id="section5" class="cd-section">
		<h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>
		<p>
			This placement was an enlightening experience. A lot of things went even better than I expected. But there
			were some lessons I learnt that I wish I’d learned earlier. <br><br> If I had the opportunity to go through
			this
			placement again, I would place more emphasis on the culture of asking questions and being proactive in
			seeking help. I know I’d have made less mistakes if I asked more questions. <br><br> A second chance at this
			placement would’ve awarded me an opportunity to take on a wider range of tasks and truly diversify my
			skillset.
		</p>
	</section><!-- cd-section -->

	<section id="section6" class="cd-section">
		<h2>My advice to you</h2>
		<p>My advice to any individual taking on an internship? Give it your all. <br><br>
			Work on getting a placement at an organization whose culture and identity fall in line with your interests.
			It will never feel like a job if you love what you’re doing and you’re having fun doing it. Put your effort
			into what ever tasks you’re assigned. Ask questions on things you don’t understand and report back to your
			manager regularly. Don’t be afraid to take on tasks outside your comfort zone and learn new things. <br><br> The most
			important thing is to make sure that you’re constantly creating value for company and yourself.
